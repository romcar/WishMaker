# üîê Authentication Security Guide

This document provides security guidelines and best practices for the WishMaker authentication system.

## üéØ Overview

The WishMaker authentication system implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Password Security
- **bcrypt hashing** with configurable salt rounds (default: 12)
- **Password complexity requirements** (length, character variety)
- **Password breach detection** integration planned
- **Account lockout** after failed login attempts

### Token Security
- **JWT implementation** with secure secret keys
- **Token rotation** on refresh for enhanced security
- **Short-lived session tokens** (1 hour default)
- **HTTP-only cookies** for production deployment

### WebAuthn Implementation
- **FIDO2 compliance** for cross-platform compatibility
- **Biometric authentication** support
- **Hardware security key** integration
- **Challenge-response** authentication flow

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- **TOTP-based** second factor using otplib
- **QR code generation** for authenticator app setup
- **Backup codes** for account recovery (planned)
- **Device trust management** (planned)

## üö® Security Best Practices

### Authentication Flow Security
1. **Rate limiting** on all authentication endpoints
2. **HTTPS enforcement** in production environments
3. **CSRF protection** with secure headers
4. **XSS prevention** with proper input sanitization

### Database Security
1. **SQL injection prevention** with parameterized queries
2. **Connection encryption** with SSL/TLS
3. **Credential management** with environment variables
4. **Database access logging** for audit trails

### Session Management
1. **Secure session storage** with encrypted cookies
2. **Session invalidation** on logout
3. **Concurrent session limits** per user
4. **Session timeout** enforcement

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Planned Security Features (ROM-5)
- [ ] **Failed login attempt monitoring** and alerting
- [ ] **Suspicious activity detection** and blocking
- [ ] **Security audit logging** for compliance
- [ ] **Penetration testing** and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] **Security headers** implementation (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### Compliance Considerations
- **GDPR compliance** for data protection
- **SOC 2** security standards alignment
- **Regular security audits** and assessments
- **Incident response procedures** documentation
