## üîó Code-to-Ticket Integration

### TODO Comment Format

All TODO comments in the codebase follow a standardized format that links directly to Linear tickets:

```typescript
// TODO: [PRIORITY] - [Description]
// üé´ Linear Ticket: [Linear URL]
// [Detailed implementation steps]
```

### Example Integration

```typescript
// backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts
// TODO: CRITICAL - Implement comprehensive password validation
// üé´ Linear Ticket: https://linear.app/romcar/issue/ROM-5/implement-security-vulnerabilities-fixes-and-authentication
// 1. Add password strength requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
// 2. Implement password history to prevent reuse
// 3. Add password expiration and forced updates
// 4. Create password policy configuration system
// 5. Add breach detection using HaveIBeenPwned API
// 6. Implement account lockout after failed attempts
// 7. Add password recovery with secure token generation
```

### Traceability Benefits

1. **Direct Navigation**: Developers can click Linear URLs in code comments
2. **Context Preservation**: Full implementation details in code alongside tickets
3. **Progress Tracking**: Code completion directly updates ticket progress
4. **Review Efficiency**: Code reviewers can understand broader context
5. **Project Management**: PMs can see code-level progress in Linear

## üìä Development Workflow

### 1. Ticket Creation Process
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Identify Improvement Area] --> B[Create Linear Ticket]
    B --> C[Add Detailed Requirements]
    C --> D[Set Priority & Labels]
    D --> E[Link to Code TODOs]
    E --> F[Begin Implementation]
```

### 2. Code Development Process
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Development] --> B[Add TODO Comments]
    B --> C[Reference Linear Ticket]
    C --> D[Implement Feature]
    D --> E[Update Ticket Status]
    E --> F[Code Review]
    F --> G[Merge & Close Ticket]
```

### 3. Ticket Lifecycle

1. **Planning**: Create ticket with detailed requirements
2. **Development**: Add code TODOs linking to ticket
3. **Implementation**: Develop features according to ticket specifications
4. **Review**: Use ticket context for code review
5. **Completion**: Mark ticket as done when code is merged

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Integration

### Linear API Integration
```typescript
// Future enhancement: Automatic ticket updates
const updateLinearTicket = async (ticketId: string, status: string) => {
  // Implementation for automatic ticket status updates
  // based on code completion percentage
};
```

### Automated Workflow Features
- **Code Scanning**: Identify TODO comments with Linear links
- **Progress Tracking**: Calculate completion percentage from code TODOs
- **Status Sync**: Update Linear tickets based on code changes
- **Report Generation**: Create development progress reports

## üìà Metrics & Reporting

### Development Metrics
- **Ticket Completion Rate**: Percentage of tickets closed per sprint
- **Code Coverage**: TODO items implemented vs. total identified
- **Implementation Time**: Average time from ticket creation to completion
- **Quality Metrics**: Bug reports and security issues addressed

### Linear Dashboard Features
- **Sprint Progress**: Visual representation of ticket completion
- **Priority Distribution**: Breakdown of critical, high, medium, low priority items
- **Team Velocity**: Development speed and capacity planning
- **Backlog Health**: Upcoming work organization and estimation

## üöÄ Best Practices

### Creating Effective Tickets
1. **Clear Titles**: Use descriptive, action-oriented titles
2. **Detailed Descriptions**: Include context, requirements, and acceptance criteria
3. **Proper Labeling**: Use consistent labels for categorization
4. **Priority Setting**: Align with business and technical priorities
5. **Linked Resources**: Connect related tickets and documentation

### Code Integration Standards
1. **Consistent Format**: Follow standardized TODO comment format
2. **Implementation Details**: Include specific steps in TODO comments
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep ticket status current with code progress
4. **Review References**: Use ticket links during code reviews
5. **Documentation**: Update docs when tickets are completed

### Workflow Optimization
1. **Sprint Planning**: Use Linear for sprint organization and capacity planning
2. **Standup Integration**: Reference ticket IDs in daily updates
3. **Retrospective Data**: Use Linear metrics for team retrospectives
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and optimize workflow processes

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Broken Links**: Ensure Linear URLs are accessible to all team members
- **Outdated TODOs**: Regularly review and update TODO comments
- **Ticket Drift**: Keep ticket descriptions aligned with implementation reality
- **Permission Issues**: Verify team member access to Linear workspace

### Maintenance Tasks
- Weekly review of open tickets and progress
- Monthly cleanup of completed TODOs from codebase
- Quarterly workflow assessment and optimization
- Annual review of Linear workspace organization
