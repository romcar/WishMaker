# Docker Security Best Practices for WishMaker

## Issue: Sensitive Data in Docker Images

### Problem
The Docker linter correctly identified that sensitive data should not be used in ARG or ENV instructions, as they become part of the Docker image layers and can be inspected.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Dockerfile Changes**
- Added comprehensive security comments explaining best practices
- Distinguished between truly sensitive data and client-side keys
- Maintained React build functionality while documenting security approach

#### 2. **Docker Compose Changes**
- Kept environment variables in build args (required for React builds)
- Added detailed comments explaining Supabase security model
- Maintained clean separation of concerns

#### 3. **Supabase Anon Key Considerations**
**Important**: Supabase anon keys are designed to be client-side public keys:
- They're meant to be included in frontend bundles
- They're protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- They have limited permissions (anon role only)
- The real security comes from RLS policies, not hiding the key

However, for production deployments, consider:
- Using Docker secrets for container orchestration
- CI/CD secret management (GitHub Secrets, etc.)
- Environment-specific configuration files

#### 4. **Production Recommendations**

For production deployments:

```dockerfile
# Production multi-stage build example
FROM node:18-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Build with secrets (production)
COPY . .
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=supabase_url \
    --mount=type=secret,id=supabase_key \
    REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=$(cat /run/secrets/supabase_url) \
    REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=$(cat /run/secrets/supabase_key) \
    npm run build

# Production runtime
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
```

#### 5. **Local Development**
For local development, the current approach with `.env.local` is acceptable because:
- The container is not pushed to registries
- It's only for local development
- Supabase anon keys are designed to be client-side

#### 6. **Security Clarification**
**Updated Approach**: After initial implementation, we restored Supabase environment variables to build args because:

1. **React Requirement**: React apps need environment variables at **build time** to embed in static bundles
2. **Supabase Design**: Anon keys are specifically designed to be client-side and public
3. **Security Model**: Protection comes from RLS policies, not hiding the anon key
4. **Best Practice**: Proper documentation and comments explain the security model

**Key Point**: The Docker linter warning applies to truly sensitive data (passwords, private keys, etc.), not client-side API keys that are designed to be public.

### Security Status: âœ… RESOLVED WITH CLARIFICATION
- Proper distinction between sensitive and client-side data
- Comprehensive documentation of security model
- React build functionality restored
- Production-ready architecture documented
