# Docker Security Best Practices for WishMaker

## Issue: Sensitive Data in Docker Images

### Problem
The Docker linter correctly identified that sensitive data should not be used in ARG or ENV instructions, as they become part of the Docker image layers and can be inspected.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Dockerfile Changes**
- Removed sensitive environment variables from ARG/ENV instructions
- Only kept non-sensitive build variables (PUBLIC_URL, REACT_APP_API_URL)
- Added security comments explaining best practices

#### 2. **Docker Compose Changes**
- Removed sensitive data from build args
- Kept sensitive data in runtime environment variables via `.env.local`
- Added comments explaining the security approach

#### 3. **Supabase Anon Key Considerations**
**Important**: Supabase anon keys are designed to be client-side public keys:
- They're meant to be included in frontend bundles
- They're protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- They have limited permissions (anon role only)
- The real security comes from RLS policies, not hiding the key

However, for production deployments, consider:
- Using Docker secrets for container orchestration
- CI/CD secret management (GitHub Secrets, etc.)
- Environment-specific configuration files

#### 4. **Production Recommendations**

For production deployments:

```dockerfile
# Production multi-stage build example
FROM node:18-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Build with secrets (production)
COPY . .
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=supabase_url \
    --mount=type=secret,id=supabase_key \
    REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=$(cat /run/secrets/supabase_url) \
    REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=$(cat /run/secrets/supabase_key) \
    npm run build

# Production runtime
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
```

#### 5. **Local Development**
For local development, the current approach with `.env.local` is acceptable because:
- The container is not pushed to registries
- It's only for local development
- Supabase anon keys are designed to be client-side

### Security Status: âœ… RESOLVED
- Sensitive data removed from Docker image layers
- Production-ready architecture documented
- Local development remains functional
