# 📊 Performance Monitoring Guide

This document outlines performance monitoring strategies and tools for the WishMaker application.

## 🎯 Overview

Performance monitoring ensures the WishMaker application delivers optimal user experience through comprehensive metrics collection, analysis, and optimization.

## 🔧 Web Vitals Integration

### Core Web Vitals Metrics
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Loading performance measurement
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: Interactivity responsiveness  
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Visual stability tracking

### Implementation
The WishMaker application includes built-in Web Vitals reporting accessible through:
- Development toolbar (development environment only)
- Console logging for performance metrics
- Production analytics integration

### Usage
```bash
# Development mode - toolbar appears automatically
npm start

# View performance metrics in browser console
# Metrics are logged automatically during user interactions
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Frontend Performance
- Bundle size optimization
- Component render performance
- API response times
- Client-side error tracking

### Backend Performance  
- API endpoint response times
- Database query performance
- Memory usage monitoring
- CPU utilization tracking

## 🛠️ Monitoring Tools

### Current Implementation
